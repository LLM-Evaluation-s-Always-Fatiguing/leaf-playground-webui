## Development

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Requirements

- yarn >= 1.22.10
- node >= 18
- Running [leaf-playground](https://github.com/LLM-Evaluation-s-Always-Fatiguing/leaf-playground)

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The Playground is initially configured to use the address `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. If you wish to change this, you can do so by setting a new address through the `PLAYGROUND_SERVER_BASE_URL` environment variable.


### Custom Scene Visualization Components

To develop customized visualization components for specific scenes, follow these unified steps:

1. **Create Component**:
  - Develop your custom scene visualization component in the `src/app/processing/components/specialized` directory.
  - Ensure the component's props extend from `DefaultProcessingVisualizationComponentProps`.

2. **Register Component**:
  - Register your component within the `getProcessingVisualizationComponent` function located in `src/app/processing/[taskId]/page.tsx`.
  - This is achieved by adding a case statement for your scene's name.

### Add Scene-Specific Result Report Components

To display custom scene result components in the Report section of the result page, follow these unified steps:

1. **Define Component**:
  - Define your component as either a `ResultReportFunctionComponent` or a `ResultReportClassComponent`, depending on your implementation approach.
  - It's recommended to store these custom components in the `src/app/result/components/specialized` directory.

2. **Register Component**:
  - Register your component within the `getSpecializedReportComponents` function found in `src/app/result/[taskId]/page.tsx`.
  - Ensure the registration occurs after the validation process by `checkMetrics`.


### Make WebUI Bundle

To make a production-ready bundle, run the following command:

```bash
yarn bundle
```

This will create a `bundle` directory with the bundled files.
